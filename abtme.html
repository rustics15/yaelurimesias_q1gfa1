    <p>My name is Yael Uri Mesias. I am 14 years old. I used to play a lot of video games, both on PS4 and PC. My first 2 videogames were Minecraft and Roblox, and I got these two way back in 2017. Ever since then, I've spent almost a thousand hours on both of those games. When I was grade 3, I got gifted Rainbow Six: Siege and I have 300 hours worth of gameplay on casual (I never played ranked.) Then I was gifted GTA V, and I played that for around 500 hours. Unfortunately, my console broke and I had to resort to PC Games. I downloaded Valorant and Apex, and I have roughly 150 hours on Apex, and 500 hours on valorant. I bought 3 AC games, and rebought r6. All these games totaled to about 2k hours in gaming. This all ended when I decided to get a life and touch grass, and now I am happier than ever, frolicking in the green grass of PSHS SMC.
